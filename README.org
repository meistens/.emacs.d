* Docs is a work in progress
** It will contain my progress so far and yep, credits will be given (couldn't have done it without looking at their configs and emacswiki too)
*** Why this long to figure stuff out? What if i told you i botched up my setup trying to be unique (realized after trying and failing to get Org to work)

Ah well, once I'm done, i'll be cleaning up the code and other stuff... time to get serious y'all

Notes:
- vterm setup, eshell is not a proper shell per se (am i right?), shell is not what I wanna use
- Org setup
- Dashboard (maybe... or not, scratch looks nice)
- More tweaks to make things better (next line after 80 char met on current frame, keep same frame size,...)
