* My Personal Emacs Config File

This is the setup I use in my day-to-day use of Emacs. Check out the elisp folder to take a peek at my configs.

Tested with the following;
OS: Fedora Workstation 37 with GNOME
Emacs Version: 28.2

If you're trying to clone and use on a windows system, best you watch out for doom-modeline. Last time I tried to on a windows system, doom-modeline crashed Emacs, not sure if its different now.

** Credits (would still be scratching my head wondering why Emacs kept freezing without looking at their configs)
